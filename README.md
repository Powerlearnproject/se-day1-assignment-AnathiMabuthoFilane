Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
= Software engineering is the process of designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software applications. This is considered as a tool that can help one to complete a certain task. Technology is important as it allows us to do certain tasks using Technocal Gadgets rather  that doing everything by hand/physically.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
= the emergence of structured programming methodologies, the adoption of object-oriented programming (OOP), and the rise of Agile development practices

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
= 1 Planning - define the project's goals, and the timeline to build your software.
= 2 Testing - run the software in order to look for flaws, or analyze bugs.
= 3 Deployment - Putting the software's product into production so that it can reach the end user.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
= 

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
= A Software Developer develops a model to suit a certain goal/achievement and makes sure that the software programme runs bug-free.
= A Quality Assurance engineer makes sure that the tool which has been developed by the software engineer is good enough to meet it's purpose and goals which it has been developed for.
= A Project Manager is the one who oversees the entire software development process. This includes planning and executing measures to make sure that the project/goal gets delivered on time.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
= Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) - this is important as it offers tools for writing, editing, debugging, and building a code. This helps prograammers to be more efficient with completing their goal on time. An example of this would be visual studios.
= Version Control Systems (VCS) - a tool that helps to keep track of any changes to files over a certain period of time. A good example of this would be  Git.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
= Rapid changes with Technology, which would force them to always keep up. 
= Debugging. This could be prevented by developing a system that would be able to secure data, as well as analyzing a software to prevent any bugs during the time of use.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
= Unit Testing - process of testing the smallest parts of your code to make sure they work correctly. 
= Integration Testing - testing different units, modules, or components.
= System Testing - testing the overall system or software to make sure all different components are contributing withing the same goal of the software.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
= Promppt Engineering - The process of writing instructions that guide AI models to prodece specific outputs. This is important in AI due to changes within Technology to make sure that all the answers that individuals may be looking for are available.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
